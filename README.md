This is a game I made in three days at TOJam 9.

If you're expecting amazing code, think again! Things that are done in three days aren't usually the best. I also haven't bothered to update this. The reason I am posting this is because I like that it shows off a component-based programming style.

You can find the download to the game on my website: http://lucrecious.com
